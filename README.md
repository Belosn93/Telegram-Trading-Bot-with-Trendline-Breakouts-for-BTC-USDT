# Telegram-Trading-Bot-with-Trendline-Breakouts-for-BTC-USDT
Developed a Python bot for automatic analysis of BTC/USDT using the ccxt library. The bot builds  trendlines, detects breakouts with confirmation by volume and risk/reward ratio, and calculates  stop-loss, take-profit, and liquidation price. Upon signal detection, it sends a chart with detailed  explanation and position calculation to Telegram.
